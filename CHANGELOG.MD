## [2024.1.1] - WIP
### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect behavior of `Entity.GetWorld` when using multiworld setup.
- Fixed several minor bugs in `WorldBrowser`.

### Added
- Added automatic static data cleanup for `World` and `EntityProvider` when exiting playmode in Unity Editor.
- Added ability to add and remove components in `WorldBrowser`.
- Added remote debug functionality for `WorldBrowser`.
- Added `MORPEH_REMOTE_BROWSER` directive.

### Removed
- Removed `MORPEH_NON_SERIALIZED` directive.

## [2024.1.0] - 11.12.2024
### Fixed
- Fixed archetype recreation when an archetype becomes empty in the same Commit call when the archetype has to become active again.
- Fixed `FastList<T>.RemoveAtSwap()` incorrect logic & managed pointers memory leak.
- Fixed multiple IL2CPP static guards and extra setup code in different methods.
- Fixed Disposable components not being disposed when its `Stash`'s World is disposed.
- Fixed code formatting in multiple files.
- Fixed Incorrect `IntHashSet` enumerator implementation for positive values.
- Fixed broken `IntHashSet.CopyTo()` method.
- Fixed data cleanup in multiple places to avoid memory leaks if `World`/specific things are disposed.
- Fixed `World.Commit()` updating metrics even in release builds.
- Fixed `InitializationDefaultWorld` disposing existing worlds when it should not.
- Fixed incorrect `World` id assignment - in some cases, it was possible to get two worlds with the same id. Now worlds reuse ids correctly.
- Reduced GC allocation count in `FilterBuilder`.
- Reduced debug builds overhead in general.
- Reduced overall generic type count to reduce IL2CPP metadata size.
- Improved performance of `Filter.First()`, `Filter.FirstOrDefault()`, `Filter.GetEntity()`.
- Significantly improved performance of `World.Commit()`, `Stash.Set()`, `Stash.Add()`, `Stash.Remove()`.
- `Entity` copying is no longer performed during `filter.AsNative()`. Entities are read directly from the archetypes.

### Added
- **[Breaking]** Added `World` ID limit (256).
- Added Entity ID and components search to the World Browser.
- Added tests for the most part of the codebase.
- Added very basic benchmarks for iterations, structural changes, etc.
- Added `Filter.Dispose()` method.
- Added generations to worlds.
- Added exceptions for typical runtime errors like InvalidSetOperationException both in Debug and Release mode.
- Added meaningful exception messages for common errors with an actual component type and entity ID where applicable.
- Added `World.Has(Entity entity)` & `World.IsDisposed(Entity entity)` methods as a faster alternative to `Entity.IsDisposed()`.
- Added `Filter.ArchetypesCount` property.
- Added `Filter.Has(Entity entity)` method.
- Added entity debugger proxy with component visualization during breakpoint debugging - components are now displayed directly on entities when paused.

### Changed
- **[Breaking]** `Entity` is now a struct instead of a class and no longer has `partial` modifier.
- **[Breaking]** `Entity.Invalid` -> `default(Entity)`.
- **[Breaking]** Native API now uses `Entity` directly instead of removed `EntityId`.
- **[Breaking]** `EntityExtensions` (`Entity.Add<T>()`, etc.) methods are now marked as Obsolete because of a potential removal in future versions of Morpeh.
- **[Breaking]** `Stash<T>` initial size functionality is now a part of `ComponentId`.
- **[Breaking]** `ComponentId` and `ExtendedComponentId` are now split into different use cases to reduce IL2CPP metadata size. `ExtendedComponentId` is now stripped out of non-UnityEditor runtimes unless `MORPEH_GENERATE_ALL_EXTENDED_IDS` is specified.
- **[Breaking]** `bool Stash<T>.Add(Entity entity)` now throws an exception if the entity already has the component. Refer to the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) for more detailed explanation.
- **[Breaking]** Base `Stash` class changed to `IStash` interface.
- **[Breaking]** `FilterBuilder` is now a struct instead of a class.
- Reworked World Browser window to be more performant.
- Reworked the entire repo structure to allow for extra projects like tests and benchmarks.
- Reworked archetypes and filter matching to be much more efficient without recursive calls, Stash checks, etc.
- Simplified `Filter` enumeration.
- Restored multiple collections' internal storage to managed arrays to make debugging memory easier.
- `Stash<T>` initial size functionality is now a part of `ComponentId`. Use `ComponentId<T>.StashSize` to modify the initial size of the stash before the first call to `World.GetStash<T>()`.
- `IntHashMap` & `LongHashMap` - `GetValueByKey` and `GetValueRefByKey` methods now throw exceptions when attempting to get a value using an invalid key.
- `FastList<T>` implementation is now less error-prone and has a more consistent API.
- `World.Default` access does not require an array access anymore.
- `StashMap` -> `IntSlotMap`.
- `Filter` chunks (used for `AsNative()` calls) are now allocated only if necessary.
- `NativeStash` uses `NativeIntSlotMap` instead of removed `NativeIntHashMap<T>`.
- Class `HashHelpers` is now public.
- `Archetype` class is now public, while its structure remains internal. This allows for less painful development of extensions for the internal part of Morpeh, and enables interaction with the `Archetype` type in user code.
- The entity's components set is now stored in its `Archetype` rather than directly in the `Entity`.
- *internal TypeInfo* typeOffset has been renamed to typeId, and what was previously typeId is now typeHash.

### Removed

- **[Breaking]** Removed `EntityId`, `World.TryGetEntity` and `World.GetEntity`.
- Removed `BitMap<T>`.
- Removed `UnmanagedList<T>`.

## [2022.2.2] - 26.02.2023
### Fixed
- Stashes were cleaned incorrectly. https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh/issues/170

## [2022.2.1] - 16.01.2023

### Fixed
- Disable warnings for Unity 2021+

## [2022.2.0] - 28.12.2022
### Added
- Added `ICleanupSystem` suitable for cleanup logic. Called by the most recent in LateUpdate by default.
- Added to `World` method `GetReflectionStash` to get stash not via generic argument, but by `System.Type`.
- Added a `MORPEH_THREAD_SAFETY` define that forces the kernel to validate that all calls come from the same thread the world was created on. The binding to a thread can be changed using the `World.GetThreadId(), World.SetThreadId()` methods.

- Unmanaged Collections for Jobs & Burst.

### Changed
- **[Breaking]** Minimal Unity version up to 2020.3.*
- **[Breaking]** Rename namespaces `Morpeh/XCrew.Morpeh` -> `Scellecs.Morpeh`
- **[Breaking]** Globals placed in a separate package via the link https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh.globals
- **[Breaking]** Method `World.UpdateFilters()` renamed to `World.Commit()`.
- **[Breaking]** Class `ComponentsCache<>` renamed to `Stash<>`. All stash methods lost prefix `Component`, now it's `Add, Get, Set, Has, Remove`.
- **[Breaking]** Filters validate that there are no duplicate types in them. For example, `Filter.With<A>().With<A>()` will throw an error.
- **[Breaking]** Removed the `Filter` property from systems, use `World.Filter` instead.
- The mechanism for cleaning components has been redesigned. Now the component must implement `IDisposable`, and it is necessary to call the `AsDisposable` method of the stash once in order for the cleanup to take place. For example, the shortest version is `World.GetStash<T>().AsDisposable()`.
- For `Installer` property `BasePair.System` now has public setter.
- `EntityProvider` and `MonoProvider` are now optimized in methods `OnEnable(), OnDisable()` 

### Fixed
- `GetLengthSlow()` sometimes gave the wrong length.
- `IconsSetter` no longer gives a warning in Unity 2021+
- Cannot add validate method for menu item warning.
- `ComponentsCacheDisposable` doesn't work with AOT fixed by redesign.
